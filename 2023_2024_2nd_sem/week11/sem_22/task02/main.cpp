/*
Develop a flexible logging system that supports logging messages to different outputs: a file, a database,
 and a network. Your task is to design a base `Logger` class with a virtual method for logging messages. Then,
 extend this base class with three specific logger types:

1. **FileLogger** - logs messages to a file. It should append messages to the specified file, opening the file in
 append mode. If the file cannot be opened, the system should report an error.

2. **DatabaseLogger** - simulates logging to a database by outputting a message to the console indicating that the
 logging is being done to a database.

3. **NetworkLogger** - simulates logging to a network location by outputting a message to the console indicating that
 the logging is being done over a network.

To manage the creation of logger objects, implement a `LoggerFactory` class with a method `createLogger` that takes
 an enum value indicating the desired logger type and returns a logger object of that type. The factory should support
 creating objects of types `FileLogger`, `DatabaseLogger`, and `NetworkLogger`.

In the main function, demonstrate the usage of your logging system by creating one logger of each type and logging a
 message to show how each logger type handles the message.

Ensure your implementation:
- Follows the principles of object-oriented design, particularly polymorphism for the logging functionality.
- Manages resources properly, especially file handles in the `FileLogger`.
- Provides meaningful output to the console to indicate where the message is being logged for the `DatabaseLogger`
 and `NetworkLogger`.

This task will test your ability to use polymorphism, design patterns (specifically, the Factory Method), and resource
 management in C++.
